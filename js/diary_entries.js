      <p>This morning I woke up before sunrise. The world was still, and I felt a gentle calm.</p>
      <p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> I realized how important it is to pause and breathe.</p>
      <p><em>Even 10 minutes of quiet reflection can reset your mind for the day.</em></p>
      <p>I spent some time journaling, noting down gratitude and small wins.</p>
      <p>Later, a cup of coffee in hand, I watched the sky turn from dark blue to golden hues — a perfect start.</p>
      <p>Remember: small moments of peace matter more than we think.</p>
